# App Flows

App-flows allows you to bring your existing UI-based app workloads to the AI-driven copilot and agent interface. At the core, app-flows provides a runtime for executing complex business task involving multiple turns, branches, loops while interacting with the existing application UI in a headless browser in a fashion similar to how a real human user would do so. An app-flows process is described in a **Domain Specific Language** (DSL) with a number of built-in LLM-based intelligent capabilities.

App-flows is also integrated with the Microsoft Copilot Studio (MCS) allowing for its availability in supported MCS channels and the rest of the MCS ecosystem.
